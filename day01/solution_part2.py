# Task: Calculate similarity score between two lists

def solve_part2():

    This function calculates the similarity score between two lists.
    A similarity score is calculated by:
    1. Taking each number from the left list
    2. Counting how many times it appears in the right list
    3. Multiplying the number by its count
    4. Adding all these products together

    # Step 1: Create empty lists to store our numbers
    # Think of lists like containers that can hold multiple items
    left_list = []   # This will hold numbers from the first column
    right_list = []  # This will hold numbers from the second column
